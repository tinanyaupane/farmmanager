# 🎯 INTEGRATION STATUS - ALL PAGES

## ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ **Login Page** - Fully integrated with API
2. ✅ **Register Page** - Fully integrated with API  
3. ✅ **API Service** - All endpoints ready
4. ✅ **Auth Context** - State management complete
5. ✅ **Protected Routes** - Guards working


## ⏳ IN PROGRESS - CREATE `.env` FILE

**CRITICAL:** Create this file now!

```bash
# File: frontend/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Then restart frontend: `npm run dev`


## 📝 REMAINING PAGES TO INTEGRATE

All remaining pages already have mock data. They just need API calls.
I'll create them all now - just minor updates!
